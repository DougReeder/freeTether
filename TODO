High Priority
=============
* Disable toggles (or autoenable) usb or bt if usbnet or pan is not enabled
* Separate linked list to generic lists in own .c file (along with separating 
  other things like sysinfo helpers).
* Fix/Verify the subscriptions.
  NOTE I do not think dhcp lease information subscription really works, well
  the subscription might just die when the lease ends / client disconnects.
* Fix/Verify the tracking of all states and error conditions.
* Use the structure values not hardcoded bridge0 and ip addresses.
* Check into libnetbridge (currently returning funky values)
* Make sure ip forwarding is solid (does work for USB too or will need to 
  bring back mount trick?)
* Fix remove interface to go through list of interfaces, don't just shutdown 
  everything.
* Fix the cleaning up and disconnecting states
* LOTS of memory allocation, fine tooth comb for leaks!
* Verify mutexes and put some around subscribe globals
* Add some sort of emergency recover, start from scratch, wipe out all 
  interfaces button for now
* Might want to verify no existing connections (e.g. via MHS) before killing 
  mobilehotspotd
* Need to figure out how to know a client is connected via usb, or re-do the 
  structures.  A lot of stuff was made to mimic mobilehotspost service's output
  but maybe we don't need to care about all of it.  The current structures are
  set up so that the interface is the upper level, and each interface contains
  a list of clients.  But maybe the client list should be the upper level, so
  that unknown interfaces can be seen/listed as well.  Now that the POC is 
  done, re-design without caring what mobilehotspot service json setup is may 
  be in order.
* LSMessageIsSubscription() doesn't seem to work on 2.0, just look for 
  subscribed: true I suppose?

Medium Priority
===============
* Move prefs to a menu
* ADD client info scene on tap of client from client list

Low Priority
============
* Fix icons on toggle page
* Add fade to bottom
* Improve snap to top behavior
* Spinner for turning on interface, at least wifi
* WebOS 2.0 - exhibition, just type, activity etc...
* dash/notifications
