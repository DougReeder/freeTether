* Implement client list for interfaces (mac/hostname pairs).
* Separate linked list to generic lists in own .c file.
* Fix/Verify the subscriptions and subscribe to the relevant methods at beginning of run.
  NOTE I do not think dhcp lease information subscription really works
* Fix/Verify the tracking of all states and error conditions.
* Implement sysInfo to report everything back to mojo via subscription.
* Don't ip forward if the lease callback is empty leases.
* Use the structure values not hardcoded bridge0 and ip addresses.
* Check into libnetbridge (currently returning funky values)
* Make sure ip forwarding is solid.
