GUI TODOs
=========
- Fix icons on toggle page
- Add fade to bottom
- Improve snap to top behavior
- Change to multi-scene rather than toggles
- Webos Internals style top header for main scene + changelog/startup scene
- Spinner for turning on interface, at least wifi

========================
* Separate linked list to generic lists in own .c file (along with separating other things like sysinfo helpers).
* Fix/Verify the subscriptions.
  NOTE I do not think dhcp lease information subscription really works, well the subscription might just die when the lease ends / client disconnects.
* Fix/Verify the tracking of all states and error conditions.
* Use the structure values not hardcoded bridge0 and ip addresses.
* Check into libnetbridge (currently returning funky values)
* Make sure ip forwarding is solid (does work for USB too or will need to bring back mount trick?)
* Fix remove interface to go through list of interfaces, don't just shutdown everything.
* dash/notifications
* WebOS 2.0 - exhibition, just type, activity etc...
* Fix the cleaning up and disconnecting states
* LOTS of memory allocation, fine tooth comb for leaks!
* Verify mutexes and put some around subscribe globals
* Add some sort of emergency recover, start from scratch, wipe out all interfaces button for now
* Might want to verify no existing connections (e.g. via MHS) before killing mobilehotspotd

* Need to figure out how to know a client is connected via usb, or re-do the structures.  A lot of stuff was made to mimic mobilehotspost service's output but maybe we don't need to care about all of it.  The current structures are set up so that the interface is the upper level, and each interface contains a list of clients.  But maybe the client list should be the upper level, so that unknown interfaces can be seen/listed as well.  Now that the POC is done, re-design without caring what mobilehotspot service json setup is may be in order.

* ADD client info scene on tap of client from client list
* Do not allow addInterface() to succeed for usb if usbnet is not enabled
* LSMessageIsSubscription() doesn't seem to work on 2.0, just look for subscribed: true I suppose?
