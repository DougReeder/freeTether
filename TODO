* Separate linked list to generic lists in own .c file (along with separating other things like sysinfo helpers).
* Fix/Verify the subscriptions.
  NOTE I do not think dhcp lease information subscription really works, well the subscription might just die when the lease ends / client disconnects.
* Fix/Verify the tracking of all states and error conditions.
* Use the structure values not hardcoded bridge0 and ip addresses.
* Check into libnetbridge (currently returning funky values)
* Make sure ip forwarding is solid (does work for USB too or will need to bring back mount trick?)
* Fix remove interface to go through list of interfaces, don't just shutdown everything.
* MOJO MOJO MOJO
* dash/notifications
* WebOS 2.0 - exhibition, just type, activity etc...
